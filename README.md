# Clickbait_Detection

1. Custom Implementation
The custom implementation involves building a clickbait detector from scratch using Transformers.

2. Pre-trained Model
Alternatively, we offer an implementation that utilizes a pre-trained  Distill-Bert Transformer model for clickbait detection. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model on clickbait detection data, we achieve efficient and effective clickbait classification.
